In other words, there was nothing here that one would conventionally call \"Artificial Intelligence\" or even \"Machine Learning\" - we simply fit the neural network to some function values.\n","\n","Now, we will move on to something that would more commonly be referred to as \"Machine Learning\" and \"Artificial Intelligence\": We will use neural networks to make predictions for inputs *unseen* at training time.\n","\n","Technically, we also already did that in our previous assignment: Whenever you queried your occupancy network at a coordinate that wasn't in the training set, you \"generalized\" to an unseen input.\n","\n","However, since these inputs are low-dimensional, we would be compelled to call this behavior \"interpolation\", and are not overly surprised that it works, as we can easily build algorithms that will interpolate some nearest neighbors in the training set and get a similar performance.\n","\n","The key difference now will be that the inputs will be high-dimensional (think >10,000 dimensions). In such high-dimensional spaces, it is *not* straight-forward to hand-craft an algorithm that will assign a reasonable value to an input unobserved at training time.\n","\n","This, then, is what deep learning is, to date, *uniquely* good at, and is the property that has enabled them to revolutionize computer vision and NLP.\n","\n","### Contributors\n","- _Prof. Vincent Sitzmann, Scene Representation Group._\n","- _Prafull Sharma_"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f0sz1OZsoT1R"},"source":["# Setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DFlhNOvjoWqA"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install einops\n","\n","import torch, torchvision\n","from torchvision import datasets, transforms\n","from torch import nn, optim\n","from torch.nn import functional as F\n","from torch.utils.data import IterableDataset\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from typing import Callable, List, Optional, Tuple, Generator, Dict\n","import os\n","import h5py\n","import random\n","\n","import imageio\n","import os\n","import skimage\n","import h5py\n","import io\n","\n","import math\n","from einops import rearrange, repeat\n","\n","print(f\"Installed Torch version: {torch.__version__}\")\n","\n","if torch.cuda.is_available():\n","    device = torch.device(\"cuda:0\")\n","    torch.cuda.set_device(device)\n","else:\n","    device = torch.device(\"cpu\")\n","\n","print(device)\n","\n","\n","def init_weights(m):\n","    if isinstance(m, nn.Linear) or isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d) or isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d):\n","        torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tUnn1RGnr9KR"},"source":["### Testing your code\n","\n","For your convenience, we have written a little test function, \"check_function\", which will serve as a unit-test for _every function that you will be graded on_.
